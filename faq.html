                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        When should I refinance?</h3>
                    <p>It's generally a good time to refinance when mortgage rates are 2% lower than the current rate on your loan. It may be a viable option even if the
                        interest rate difference is only 1% or less. Any reduction can trim your monthly mortgage payments. Example: Your payment, excluding taxes and
                        insurance, would be about $770 on a $100,000 loan at 8.5%; if the rate were lowered to 7.5%, your payment would then be $700, now you're saving $70
                        per month. Your savings depends on your income, budget, loan amount, and interest rate changes. Your trusted lender can help you calculate your
                        options.</p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">What are points?</h3>
                    <p>A point is a percentage of the loan amount, or 1-point = 1% of the loan, so one point on a $100,000 loan is $1,000. Points are costs that need to be
                        paid to a lender to get mortgage financing under specified terms. Discount points are fees used to lower the interest rate on a mortgage loan by
                        paying some of this interest up-front. Lenders may refer to costs in terms of basic points in hundredths of a percent, 100 basis points = 1 point,
                        or 1% of the loan amount. </p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        Should I pay points to lower my interest rate?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, if you plan to stay in the property for a least a few years. Paying discount points to lower the loan's interest rate is a good way to lower
                        your required monthly loan payment, and possibly increase the loan amount that you can afford to borrow. However, if you plan to stay in the
                        property for only a year or two, your monthly savings may not be enough to recoup the cost of the discount points that you paid up-front.</p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        What is an APR?</h3>
                    <p>The annual percentage rate (APR) is an interest rate reflecting the cost of a mortgage as a yearly rate. This rate is likely to be higher than the
                        stated note rate or advertised rate on the mortgage, because it takes into account points and other credit costs. The APR allows homebuyers to
                        compare different types of mortgages based on the annual cost for each loan. The APR is designed to measure the "true cost of a loan." It creates a
                        level playing field for lenders. It prevents lenders from advertising a low rate and hiding fees.</p>                    <p>The APR does not affect your monthly payments. Your monthly payments are strictly a function of the interest rate and the length of the loan.</p>
                    <p>Because APR calculations are effected by the various different fees charged by lenders, a loan with a lower APR is not necessarily a better rate.
                        The best way to compare loans is to
                        ask lenders to provide you with a good-faith estimate of their costs on the
                        same type of program (e.g. 30-year fixed) at the same interest rate. You can
                        then delete the fees that are independent of the loan such as homeowners
                        insurance, title fees, escrow fees, attorney fees, etc. Now add up all the
                        loan fees. The lender that has lower loan fees has a cheaper loan than the
                        lender with higher loan fees.</p>
                    <p>The following fees are generally included in the APR:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Points - both discount points and origination points</li>
                        <li> Pre-paid interest. The interest paid from the date the loan closes to the end of the month.</li>
                        <li> Loan-processing fee</li>

                        What does it mean to lock the interest rate?</h3>
                    <p>Mortgage rates can change from the day you apply for a loan to the day you close the transaction. If interest rates rise sharply during the
                        application process it can increase the borrower's mortgage payment unexpectedly. Therefore, a lender can allow the borrower to "lock-in" the
                        loan's interest rate guaranteeing that rate for a specified time period, often 30-60 days, sometimes for a fee. </p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">

                        How is my credit judged by lenders?</h3>
                    <p>Credit scoring is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you
                        credit. Information about you and your credit experiences, such as your bill-paying
                        history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection
                        actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts, is collected from your
                        credit application and your credit report. Using a statistical program, creditors
                        compare this information to the credit performance of consumers with similar
                        profiles. A credit scoring system awards points for each factor that helps predict
                        who is most likely to repay a debt. A total number of points -- a credit score
                        -- helps predict how creditworthy you are, that is, how likely it is that you
                        will repay a loan and make the payments when due. </p>                    <p>The most widely use credit scores are FICO scores, which were developed by Fair Isaac Company, Inc. Your score will fall between 350 (high risk) and
                        850 (low risk).                    </p>
                    <p>Because your credit report is an important part of many credit scoring systems,
                        it is very important to make sure it's accurate before you submit a credit application.
                        To get copies of your report, contact the three major credit reporting agencies:
                    </p>
                    <p>Equifax: (800) 685-1111 <br>
                        Experian (formerly TRW): (888) EXPERIAN (397-3742) <br>
                        Trans Union: (800) 916-8800 <br>
                        These agencies may charge you up to $9.00 for your credit report.</p>                    <p>
                        You are entitled to receive one free credit report every 12 months from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies – Equifax,
                        Experian and TransUnion. This free credit report may not contain your credit score and can be requested through the following website:

                        What can I do to improve my credit score?</h3>
                    <p>Credit scoring models are complex and often vary among creditors and for different
                        types of credit. If one factor changes, your score may change -- but improvement
                        generally depends on how that factor relates to other factors considered by
                        the model. Only the creditor can explain what might improve your score under
                        the particular model used to evaluate your credit application.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, scoring models generally evaluate the following types of information
                        in your credit report:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Have you paid your bills on time?</strong> Payment history typically
                            is a significant factor. It is likely that your score will be affected negatively
                            if you have paid bills late, had an account referred to collections, or declared
                            bankruptcy, if that history is reflected on your credit report.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What is your outstanding debt?</strong> Many scoring models evaluate
                            the amount of debt you have compared to your credit limits. If the amount
                            you owe is close to your credit limit, that is likely to have a negative effect
                            on your score.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>How long is your credit history? </strong>Generally, models consider
                            the length of your credit track record. An insufficient credit history may
                            have an effect on your score, but that can be offset by other factors, such
                            as timely payments and low balances. <br>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Have you applied for new credit recently? </strong>Many scoring
                            models consider whether you have applied for credit recently by looking at
                            "inquiries" on your credit report when you apply for credit. If
                            you have applied for too many new accounts recently, that may negatively affect
                            your score. However, not all inquiries are counted. Inquiries by creditors
                            who are monitoring your account or looking at credit reports to make "prescreened"
                            credit offers are not counted. <br>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>How many and what types of credit accounts do you have?</strong>
                            Although it is generally good to have established credit accounts, too many
                            credit card accounts may have a negative effect on your score. In addition,
                            many models consider the type of credit accounts you have. For example, under
                            some scoring models, loans from finance companies may negatively affect your
                            credit score.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Scoring models may be based on more than just information in your credit report.
                        For example, the model may consider information from your credit application
                        as well: your job or occupation, length of employment, or whether you own a
                        home. </p>
                    <p>To improve your credit score under most models, concentrate on paying your
                        bills on time, paying down outstanding balances, and not taking on new debt.
                        It's likely to take some time to improve your score significantly. </p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        What is an appraisal?</h3>
                    <p>An Appraisal is an estimate of a property's fair market value. It's a document generally required (depending on the loan program) by a lender before
                        loan approval to ensure that the mortgage loan amount is not more than the value of the property. The Appraisal is performed by an "Appraiser"
                        typically a state-licensed professional who is trained to render expert opinions concerning property values, its location, amenities, and physical
                        conditions.</p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        What is PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)?</h3>
                    <p>On a conventional mortgage, when your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price of the home mortgage lenders usually require you get
                        Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) to protect them in case you default on your mortgage. Sometimes you may need to pay up to 1-year's worth of PMI
                        premiums at closing which can cost several hundred dollars. The best way to avoid this extra expense is to make a 20% down payment, or ask about
                        other loan program options. </p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        What is 80-10-10 financing?</h3>
                    <p>Surprising as it may seem, some folks with hefty incomes find that it's mighty tough for them to save enough money to make a 20% cash down payment
                        on their dream homes. Using conventional financing, such buyers must purchase Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) which increases the cost of home
                        ownership and, ironically, makes it even more difficult to qualify for the mortgage. However, if you're a dues-paying member of the cash-challenged
                        class, don't despair. Given that your income is sufficiently high, it's eminently possible to avoid getting stuck with PMI. That is why 80-10-10
                        financing was invented. It is called 80-10-10 because a savings and loan association, bank, or other institutional lender provides a traditional
                        80% first mortgage, you get a 10% second mortgage, and make a cash down payment equal to 10% of the home's purchase price. By using this method,
                        you are no longer obligated to take out PMI on your property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same principle applies if you can only afford to make a 5% down, 80-15-5 financing is also available. However, because a smaller cash down
                        payment increases the lender's risk of default, do not be surprised when you are asked to pay higher loan fees and a higher mortgage interest rate
                        for 80-15-5 than you pay for 80-10-10.</p>                    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">
                        What happens at closing ?</h3>
                    <p>The property is officially transferred from the seller to you at "Closing" or "Funding".</p>
                    <p>At closing, the ownership of the property is officially transferred from the seller to you. This may involve you, the seller, real estate agents,
                        your attorney, the lender's attorney, title or escrow firm representatives, clerks, secretaries, and other staff. You can have an attorney
                        represent you if you can't attend the closing meeting, i.e., if you're out-of-state. Closing can take anywhere from 1-hour to several depending on
                        contingency clauses in the purchase offer, or any escrow accounts needing to be set up. </p>                    <p>Most paperwork in closing or settlement is done by attorneys and real estate professionals. You may or may not be involved in some of the closing
                        activities; it depends on who you are working with.</p>
                    <p>Prior to closing you should have a final inspection, or "walk-through" to insure requested repairs were performed, and items agreed to remain with
                        the house are there such as drapes, lighting fixtures, etc.</p>
                    <p>In most states the settlement is completed by a title or escrow firm in which you forward all materials and information plus the appropriate
                        cashier's checks so the firm can make the necessary disbursement. Your representative will deliver the check to the seller, and then give the keys
                        to you.</p>                </div>
